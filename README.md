Gadgetbridge
============

Gadgetbridge is an Android (4.4+) application which will allow you to use your
Pebble or Mi Band without the vendor's closed source application and without the
need to create an account and transmit any of your data to the vendor's servers.

## Notes about Firmware >=3.0 (Pebble Time, updated OG)

* Gadgetbridge will keep track of installed watchfaces, but if the Pebble is used with another phone or another app, the information displayed in the app manager can get out of sync since it is impossible to query Firmware >= 3.x for installed apps/watchfaces.

## Getting Started (Pebble)

1. Pair your Pebble through the Android's Bluetooth Settings or Gadgetbridge. Pebble 2 MUST be paired though Gadgetbridge (tap on the + in Control Center)
2. Start Gadgetbridge, tap on the device you want to connect to
3. To test, choose "Debug" from the menu and play around

## How to use (Mi Band 1+2)

* When starting Gadgetbridge the first time, it will automatically
  attempt to discover and pair your Mi Band. Alternatively you can invoke discovery
  manually via the "+" button. It will ask you for some personal info that appears
  to be needed for proper steps calculation on the band. If you do not provide these,
  some hardcoded default "dummy" values will be used instead. 

  When your Mi Band starts to vibrate and blink during the pairing process,
  tap it quickly a few times in a row to confirm the pairing with the band.

1. Configure other notifications as desired
2. Go back to the "Gadgetbridge" activity
3. Tap the Mi Band item to connect if you're not connected yet
4. To test, chose "Debug" from the menu and play around

**Known Issues:**

* The initial connection to a Mi Band sometimes takes a little patience. Try to connect a few times, wait, 
  and try connecting again. This only happens until you have "bonded" with the Mi Band, i.e. until it 
  knows your MAC address. This behavior may also only occur with older firmware versions.
* If you use other apps like Mi Fit, and "bonding" with Gadgetbridge does not work, please
  try to unpair the band in the other app and try again with Gadgetbridge.
* While all Mi Band devices are supported, some firmware versions might work better than others.
  You can consult the [projects wiki pages](https://github.com/Freeyourgadget/Gadgetbridge/wiki/Mi-Band) 
  to check if your firmware version is fully supported or if an upgrade/downgrade might be beneficial.

## Features (Liveview)

* set time (automatically upon connection)
* display notifications and vibrate
